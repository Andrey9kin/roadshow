# Repositories
We use two repositories for our show case that includes pretested commits.

## RoadShow

"RoadShow" is the integration repository is where we push changes, and if validated they end up in the RoadShow-stable repository (https://github.com/Praqma/RoadShow-stable)

## RoadShow stable
* (https://github.com/Praqma/RoadShow-stable
"RoadShow-stable" is where validated changes ends if they can be verified to a certain level.
